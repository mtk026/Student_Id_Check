INTRODUCTION
A check digit1 is a form of redundancy check used for error detection on identication numbers,
such as bank account numbers, which are used in an application where they will at least sometimes
be input manually. It consists of one or more digits computed by an algorithm from the other
digits (or letters) in the sequence input.
With a check digit, one can detect simple errors in the input of a series of characters 
(usually digits) such as a single mistyped digit or some permutations of two successive digits.
Our university implements also a check digit algorithm for student numbers. 
A student number has exactly six digits. The Algorithm is as follows:
 sum   0
 For each digit in the student number that has an odd position (rst, third, fth) take the
digit and add it to the sum.
 For each digit in the student number that has an even position (second, forth, sixth) take
twice the digit. If this result of doubling is a two digit number then add each of these digits
to the sum, otherwise add the result of the doubling (which is a single digit number itself)
to the sum.
 The one digit number, which when added to the sum results in a multiple of 10, is the
check digit
Take as example the student number of 167912
1From Wikipedia denition of `check digit'
1 6 7 9 1 2
2âœ•6=12
2âœ•9=18
2âœ•2=4
1+1+2+7+1+8+1+4 =25
25+5=30 ([Closest multiple of ten]â‰¥25)
This becomes the check digit
The check digit of the student number 167912 is found to be 5. As you all well know, this is
written as 167912-5. That is called the student-id.
PROBLEM & SPECIFICATIONS
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to determine the digit that is missing from a
METU student-id or if no digit is missing to determine whether it is valid or not. A student-id
will be read from the standard input as
######-#
where each # is a decimal digit or a `?' (question mark). There will be at most one question
mark. It is also possible that no question mark appears in the input. You will be printing a single
line of output which strictly follows the below given specication:
 There is no question mark: Print VALID if the check digit is correct. Otherwise print
INVALID.
 Check digit position is question marked: Compute the check digit and print the whole
student-id (with the correct check digit present).
 One of the rst six digit position is question marked: Compute the digit position that
is question marked and print the whole student-id (with the correct digit present).
